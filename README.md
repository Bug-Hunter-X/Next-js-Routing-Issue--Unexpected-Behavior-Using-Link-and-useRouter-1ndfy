# Next.js Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to routing in Next.js.  When navigating between pages using both the `<Link>` component and the `useRouter` hook, unexpected behavior can occur. The issue specifically revolves around the state management during transitions between pages and proper handling of events and updates.

## Problem Description

The provided code includes two pages: `Home` and `About`.  The `Home` page uses the `<Link>` component to navigate to the `About` page. The `About` page utilizes the `useRouter` hook to navigate back to the `Home` page using a button.  The current implementation might exhibit inconsistencies in the rendering, showing outdated information or triggering unexpected re-renders.

## Solution

The solution addresses these problems by improving the state management during the transitions. It ensures that components properly update their state and UI based on the current route.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages to observe the issue.
